# Face_Behaviour_Detection
Face emotion detection is a popular application of deep learning in computer vision. The goal is to develop a system that can accurately identify and classify the emotional state of individuals based on facial expressions.

## Approach:
### Dataset Collection and Preprocessing:

Gather a diverse dataset of facial expressions using OpenCV and MediaPipe Holistics (e.g., happy, sad, angry).
Preprocess the images to standardize size, resolution.

### Model Architecture:
Choose a deep learning architecture suitable for image classification tasks. For this, I use LSTM Rnn Model

### Data Splitting:
Split the dataset into training, validation, and testing sets to train and evaluate the model's performance effectively.
Training:

Feed the training data into the chosen model and adjust the model's weights using optimization algorithms.

### Validation and Testing:
Use the validation set to monitor the model's performance during training and prevent overfitting.
Evaluate the trained model on the testing set to assess its generalization to unseen data.

### Loss Function:
Choose an appropriate loss function for multi-class classification tasks, such as categorical cross-entropy, to measure the difference between predicted and actual emotion labels.

### Post-Processing:
Implement post-processing techniques to smooth predictions and improve the overall quality of emotion recognition.

### Real-Time Inference:
Optimize the model for real-time inference, ensuring low latency and high efficiency when processing live video streams or individual images.
